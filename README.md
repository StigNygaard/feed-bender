# feed-bender

*Feed-bender* is a project where I create, tweak or combine various news feeds (RSS etc.) for convenience and special purposes. Either to be served for my newsreader — or as a "preburner API" for other (future planned) projects/ideas.

My first two "custom feeds" are both related to [Canon Rumors](https://canonrumors.com/).
One feed is based on CR main-site's own RSS news feed, but filtered down to only having "essential posts" by ignoring posts in some categories.
The other keeps track of new *threads* in the forum of the site, except it tries to ignore threads created to be a "comment-section" to one of the posts on the main-site.

Feed-bender uses [*Feedsmith* by *Maciej Lamberski*](https://github.com/macieklamberski/feedsmith) ([MIT](https://github.com/macieklamberski/feedsmith/blob/main/LICENSE) licensed)

This is a *Deno Deploy project* deployed at https://feed-bender.deno.dev/.
