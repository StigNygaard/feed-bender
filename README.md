# feed-bender

Tweaking various news feeds as I personally want them to be. Either served for use in the newsreader I use - or as an "preburned" API for other (planed) projects.

The first is Canon Rumors' news feed filtered down to [only essential posts](https://feed-bender.deno.dev/canon/crfeed.json), by ignoring posts in several categories.

Feed-bender uses [Feedsmith by Maciej Lamberski](https://github.com/macieklamberski/feedsmith) ([MIT](https://github.com/macieklamberski/feedsmith/blob/main/LICENSE) licensed)

This is a Deno Deploy project deployed at https://feed-bender.deno.dev/.
