# feed-bender

Feed-bender is a place where I plan to create, tweak or combine various news feeds for convenience and special purposes. Either to be served for my newsreader â€” or as a "preburned API" for other (future planned) projects/ideas.

My first "custom feed" is Canon Rumors' news-feed filtered down to [only essential posts](https://feed-bender.deno.dev/canon/crfeed.json), by ignoring posts in several categories.

Feed-bender uses [Feedsmith by Maciej Lamberski](https://github.com/macieklamberski/feedsmith) ([MIT](https://github.com/macieklamberski/feedsmith/blob/main/LICENSE) licensed)

This is a Deno Deploy project deployed at https://feed-bender.deno.dev/.
